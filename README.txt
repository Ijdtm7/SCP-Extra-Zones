I am currently rewriting this mod using MCreator, When I am finished I will try to keep the mod open source for you guys to use.
In the new rewrite expect new things like new mobs. Only downside is that you cannot go above forge 1.12.2 - 14.23.5.2768 (so techguns wont work) Although that is the reccomended version.
